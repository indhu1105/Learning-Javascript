       alert(5 > 4);//Obviously, true.

alert("apple" > "pineapple");//Dictionary comparison, hence false. "a" is smaller than "p".

alert("2" > "12");//Again, dictionary comparison, first char of "2" is greater than the first char of "1".

alert(undefined == null);//Values null and undefined equal each other only.

alert(undefined === null);//Strict equality is strict. Different types from both sides lead to false.

alert(null == "\n0\n"); //null only equals undefined.

alert(null === +"\n0\n");//Strict equality of different types.
