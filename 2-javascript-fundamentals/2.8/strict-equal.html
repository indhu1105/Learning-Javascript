        //This happens because operands of different types are converted to numbers by the equality operator ==. An empty string, just like false, becomes a zero.
        alert(''==false); //true
        alert(0==false); //true
        // "==="
        // A strict equality operator === checks the equality without type conversion.
             //In other words, if a and b are of different types, then a === b immediately returns false without an attempt to convert them.
        alert(''===false); //false
