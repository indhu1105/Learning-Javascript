    <!-- Interaction: alert, prompt, confirm
        There are two limitations shared by all the methods above:

     1.The exact location of the modal window is determined by the browser. Usually, it’s in the center.
     2.The exact look of the window also depends on the browser. We can’t modify it

    <!-- The mini-window with the message is called a modal window.  -->

    <script>
        //alert: This shows a message and pauses script execution until the user presses “OK”.
         alert("hello");

         /*prompt:

             The function prompt accepts two arguments:
                 result = prompt(title, [default]);

    It shows a modal window with a text message, an input field for the visitor, and the buttons OK/Cancel.
       1.title : The text to show the visitor.
       2.default : An optional second parameter, the initial value for the input field.
             prompts to look good in IE, we recommend always providing the second argument.

          alert(`you are ${grow} years old`);

        // confirm :
             // shows a message and waits for the user to press “OK” or “Cancel”. It returns true for OK and false for Cancel/Esc.
          let age=confirm("ok or not");
