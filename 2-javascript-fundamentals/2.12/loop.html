    <!-- We covered 3 types of loops:

1.while – The condition is checked before each iteration.
2.do..while – The condition is checked after each iteration.
3.for (;;) – The condition is checked before each iteration, additional settings available.

break:
      To make an “infinite” loop, usually the while(true) construct is used. Such a loop, just like any other, can be stopped with the break directive.

continue:
      If we don’t want to do anything in the current iteration and would like to forward to the next one, we can use the continue directive.

label:
      break/continue support labels before the loop. A label is the only way for break/continue to escape a nested loop to go to an outer one.
