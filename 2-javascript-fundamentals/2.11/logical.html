    <!-- Logical Operators
         1. OR ||
         2. AND &&
         3. NOT ! 

     -->
     <!-- OR 
         The OR || operator does the following:

            Evaluates operands from left to right.
            For each operand, converts it to boolean. If the result is true, stops and returns the original value of that operand.
            If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were false), returns the last operand.
            A value is returned in its original form, without the conversion.

            In other words, a chain of OR "||" returns the first truthy value or the last one if no truthy value is found.

    -->

    <!--  AND 

         The AND && operator does the following:

                Evaluates operands from left to right.
                For each operand, converts it to a boolean. If the result is false, stops and returns the original value of that operand.
                If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were truthy), returns the last operand.
                In other words, AND returns the first falsy value or the last value if none were found.

                The rules above are similar to OR. The difference is that AND returns the first falsy value while OR returns the first truthy one.

     -->

     <!-- NOT
          The operator accepts a single argument and does the following:

              1.  Converts the operand to boolean type: true/false.
              2.  Returns the inverse value.

                A double NOT !! is sometimes used for converting a value to boolean type

          alert( alert(1) || 2 || alert(3) ); // 1 and then 2 because alert(undefines || 2 || alert(3)) so print the truthy value "2"

        alert(null && "hllo" && true) //null
