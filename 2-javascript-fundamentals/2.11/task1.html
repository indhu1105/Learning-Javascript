    <!-- Check the range between

        Write an “if” condition to check that age is between 14 and 90 inclusively.

        “Inclusively” means that age can reach the edges 14 or 90.
     -->
     <!--  Check the range outside

            Write an if condition to check that age is NOT between 14 and 90 inclusively.

            Create two variants: the first one using NOT !, the second one – without it.
