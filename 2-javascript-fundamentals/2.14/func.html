    <!-- 
        A function declaration looks like this:

                    function name(parameters, delimited, by, comma) {
                    /* code */
                    }
      1.  Values passed to a function as parameters are copied to its local variables.
      2. A function may access outer variables. But it works only from inside out. The code outside of the function doesn’t see its local variables.
      3. A function can return a value. If it doesn’t, then its result is undefined.

        // The outer variable is only used if there’s no local one.
