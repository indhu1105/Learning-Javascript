        Function Expression vs Function Declaration
     -->
     <!-- 
        Function Expression: 
          1. A Function Expression is created when the execution reaches 
               it and is usable only from that moment.

      -->

      <!-- 
      Function Declaration:
         1.A Function Declaration can be called earlier than it is defined.
         2.In strict mode, when a Function Declaration is within a code block, 
               it’s visible everywhere inside that block. But not outside of it.
