    <!-- Why is there a semicolon at the end?

You might wonder, why does Function Expression have a semicolon ; at the end, but Function Declaration does not:

  function sayHi() {
  // ...
  }

let sayHi = function() {
  // ...
};
The answer is simple:

There’s no need for ; at the end of code blocks and syntax structures that use them like if { ... }, for { }, function f { } etc.
A Function Expression is used inside the statement: let sayHi = ...;, as a value. It’s not a code block, but rather an assignment.

The semicolon ; is recommended at the end of statements, no matter what the value is. 
So the semicolon here is not related to the Function Expression itself, it just terminates the statement.

 <!-- Summary
 
    1.Functions are values. They can be assigned, copied or declared in any place of the code.

    2.If the function is declared as a separate statement in the main code flow, that’s called a “Function Declaration”.

    3.If the function is created as a part of an expression, it’s called a “Function Expression”.

    4.Function Declarations are processed before the code block is executed. They are visible everywhere in the block.

    5.Function Expressions are created when the execution flow reaches them.
