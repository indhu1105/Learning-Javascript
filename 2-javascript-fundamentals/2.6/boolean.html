<!-- Boolean conversion
Follows the rules:

Value                          	Becomesâ€¦
0, null, undefined, NaN, ""	    false
any other value	                 true


Most of these rules are easy to understand and memorize. The notable exceptions where people usually make mistakes are:

undefined is NaN as a number, not 0.
"0" and space-only strings like " " are true as a boolean.
