    <!-- In this we study about
               1. unary :
                    "+" It actually does the same thing as Number(...) Numeric conversion
                    "-" the unary negation - reverses the sign of a number

                2.binary :
                    "+" Usually, the plus operator + sums numbers.
                             But, if the binary + is applied to strings, it merges (concatenates) them

                    "-"  Other arithmetic operators work only with numbers and always convert their operands to numbers.

               3.operand :is what operators are applied to. For instance, in the multiplication of 5 * 2 there are two operands-->

    let orange=4;
    // As we can see, the “unary plus” has a priority of 17 which is higher than the 13 of “addition” (binary plus). That’s why, in the expression "+apples + +oranges", unary pluses work before the addition.
