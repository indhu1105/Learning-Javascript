    <!-- 
        Assignment "=":The call x = value writes the value into x and then returns it.
        Remainder "%" :The result of a % b is the remainder of the integer division of a by b.
        Exponential "**" :the result of a ** b is a multiplied by itself b times.
        Increment ++ increases a variable by 1
        Decrement -- decreases a variable by 1
            Increment/decrement can only be applied to variables. Trying to use it on a value like 5++ will give an error.
        Bitwise operator:
            AND ( & )
            OR ( | )
            XOR ( ^ )
            NOT ( ~ )
            LEFT SHIFT ( << )
            RIGHT SHIFT ( >> )
            ZERO-FILL RIGHT SHIFT ( >>> )
        Comma ","
           The comma operator allows us to evaluate several expressions, dividing them with a comma ,. Each of them is evaluated but only the result of the last one is returned.

        Modify in place:
            need to apply an operator to a variable and store the new result in that same variable.
