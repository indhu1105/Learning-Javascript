<!-- A variable in JavaScript can contain any data. A variable can at one moment be a string and at another be a number
Programming languages that allow such things are called “dynamically typed” -->


<!-- There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

1.number: for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±253.
2.bigint: is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
       the "n" at the end means it's a BigInt

3.string: for strings. A string may have one or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.

     Double quotes: "Hello".
    Single quotes: 'Hello'.
    Backticks: `Hello`.
Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}



4.boolean :for true/false.
5.null: for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
6.undefined :for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
7.object: for more complex data structures.
      symbol: for unique identifiers.

8.The typeof operator allows us to see which type is stored in a variable.

Two forms: typeof x or typeof(x).
Returns a string with the name of the type, like "string".
For null returns "object" – this is an error in the language, it’s not actually an object. -->
