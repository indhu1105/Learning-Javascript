        Using "this" in object literal

        Here the function makeUser returns an object.

        What is the result of accessing its ref? Why?


        That’s because rules that set this do not look at object definition. Only the moment of call matters.

Here the value of this inside makeUser() is undefined, because it is called as a function, not as a method with “dot” syntax.

        function makeUser() {
        return {
            name: "John",
            ref: this
        };
        };

        let user = makeUser();

        alert( user.ref.name ); // What's the result?
     -->
    <script>
        //Now it works, because user.ref() is a method.
        //  And the value of this is set to the object before dot ..
        function makeUser() {
            return {
                name: "John",
                ref() {
                return this;
                }
            };
            };

let user = makeUser();

alert( user.ref().name ); // John

    </script>
