1.Brevity is the soul of wit
2.One-letter variables(avoid)
3.Use abbreviations
    =>list → lst.
    =>userAgent → ua.
    =>browser → brsr.
4.Soar high. Be abstract.
    =>The ideal name for a variable is data. 
    =>Name a variable by its type: str, num…
    =>…But what if there are no more such names? Just add a number: data1, item2, elem5…

5.Attention test
    =>One of the ways – use similar variable names, like date and data.

6.Smart synonyms
    Eg.,
     =>showMessage()
     =>displayName()
6.Reuse names
    =>An advanced variant of the approach is to covertly (!) replace the value with something alike in the middle of a loop or a function.
    => Deadly effective even against an experienced ninja.
7.Underscores for fun
     =>A smart ninja puts underscores at one spot of code and evades them at other places. 
          That makes the code even more fragile and increases the probability of future errors.
8.Show your love
    =>Let everyone see how magnificent your entities are! Names like superElement, 
          megaFrame and niceItem will definitely enlighten a reader.
9.Overlap outer variables
10.Side-effects everywhere!
   => A really beautiful trick is to add a “useful” action to them, besides the main task.
           An expression of dazed surprise on the face of your colleague when they see a function named is.., check.. or find... changing something – will definitely broaden your boundaries of reason.

   =>Another way to surprise is to return a non-standard result.
          Show your original thinking! Let the call of checkPermission return not true/false, but a complex object with the results of the check.
11.Powerful functions!
    =>Additional actions should not be obvious from the function name. A true ninja coder will make them not obvious from the code as well.
    =>Joining several actions into one protects your code from reuse.
