Comments
  => An important sign of a good developer is comments: their presence and even their absence.
  => Good comments allow us to maintain the code well, come back to it after a delay and use it more effectively.

Comment this:
   => Overall architecture, high-level view.
         There’s a special language UML to build high-level architecture diagrams explaining the code.
   => Function usage.
         The function itself becomes the comment. Such code is called self-descriptive.
   => Important solutions, especially when not immediately obvious.
Avoid comments:
    =>That tell “how code works” and “what it does”.
    =>Put them in only if it’s impossible to make the code so simple and self-descriptive that it doesn’t require them.

Comments are also used for auto-documenting tools like JSDoc3: they read them and generate HTML-docs (or docs in another format).
